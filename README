Original package by jalder (https://github.com/jalder).

- Added a currency updater (must be run as cron-job or similar)
- Added some SQL-Stuff to /admin/bitcoin.php so orders not in "Processing" are not shown in the admin center.
- Added some math-stuff to /admin/bitcoin.php so that base currency is multiplied with BTC-value. This fixes false values if BTC is not your base currency.

Move files to correct directorys.
Edit settings in "currency_updater.php", you will need a mtgox-account to request API-stuff.
Setup cron-job (or similar if you run the Microsoft mongrel) to execute currency-updater.php every day or hour or so...
